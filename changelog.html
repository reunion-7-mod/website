                        <li>After a long wait, the Basic and Classic themes are finally available in the Personalization page (of Control Panel). Props to Tech Stuff for figuring it out and to Xdek for helping me implement it!</li>

                        <li>Moved over to DWM Tweaker (thanks, Tech Stuff).</li>

                        <li>Fixed an inaccuracy where the Favorites tab was collapsed by default.</li>

                        <li>Fixed an inaccuracy where there was a non-functional feature to Pin something to Favorites, that button was not in W7 to begin with.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a small inaccuracy in the Libraries page, it used to say "Select an item to see details", now it says "... items".</li>
                        <li>Fixed an inaccuracy where the PowerShell ISE was that of W10, now it should be of W7.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a bug where the 12-hour Time Convention had a 0 next to the 1-9 hours (e.g. 09:30 → 9:30).</li>
                        <li>Finally, the correct, W7-accurate default programs appear in the Start Menu as intended (e.g. Solitaire, Windows Media Center).</li>
